# Car_Game_in_C

Abstract:

The objective of this lab report is to present the development and analysis of a simple car game implemented in C++. The car game is designed to simulate a basic driving experience, where the player can control a car using keyboard inputs to navigate through a two-dimensional environment. The primary goal is to enhance programming skills by understanding fundamental concepts of C++ and object-oriented programming.

The report will focus on the following key aspects:

Introduction:

Briefly describe the purpose of the car game and its significance in learning C++ programming.
Highlight the main functionalities and features of the game.
Design and Implementation:

Discuss the overall architecture of the car game, including the classes and data structures used.
Explain how user input is captured to control the car's movement.
Describe any additional features such as collision detection or scoring mechanisms.
Coding Challenges and Solutions:

Outline the major challenges encountered during development.
Present the strategies used to overcome these challenges, ensuring a smooth gameplay experience.
Testing and Debugging:

Explain the testing process adopted to identify and resolve any potential bugs or errors.
Provide insights into the debugging techniques applied to improve the game's stability.
Results and Performance Analysis:
